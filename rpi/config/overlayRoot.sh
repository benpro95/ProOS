### This script will mount the root filesystem read-only and overlay it with a temporary tempfs 
### which is read-write mounted. This is done using the overlayFS which is part of the linux kernel 
### since version 3.18. 
### when this script is in use, all changes made to anywhere in the root filesystem mount will be lost 
### upon reboot of the system. The SD card will only be accessed as read-only drive, which significantly
### helps to prolong its life and prevent filesystem coruption in environments where the system is usually
### not shut down properly 
###
### Install: 
### copy this script to /sbin/overlayRoot.sh, make it executable and add "init=/sbin/overlayRoot.sh" to the 
### cmdline.txt file in the raspbian image's boot partition. 
### I strongly recommend to disable swapping before using this.
### To install software, run upgrades and do other changes to the raspberry setup, simply remove the init= 
### entry from the cmdline.txt file and reboot, make the changes, add the init= entry and reboot once more. 
### This can be done by my overlayReboot.sh script, which makes the process quick and easy to do.
